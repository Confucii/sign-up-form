# Sign up Form
Odin project sign-up form. The purpose of this project is to introduce form concept, form validation, as well as, form styling principles and complexities. Furthermore, in this project relative CSS units, CSS properties, advanced selectores, absolute positioning and CSS functions can be practiced (they were introduced in study course before this project). There is also a simple script that compares passwords and gives dynamic feedback to users. One more thing it does, it checks whether all inputs are valid (including the ones checked by HTML5 validators).
